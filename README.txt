The main code is in "PROJECT-FINAL.cpp"

The code needs "File1" file and "File2" file in the repository needs to be in the same folder in which the code is

The code takes the length of DNA strands as input, for example if the length of the first strand is 100 give 100 as input and if the length of the second strand is 200 give 200 as the next input

"File1" folder contains a DNA sequences of length 100 and "File1" folder also contains another DNA sequence of length 100

Paste the File and File1 in the same location where the program is saved. 

This website--> https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/random_dna.html can be used to generate random DNA sequence

GIVE INPUT 100 and 100, to see the output.

Hope you enjoy the code. Thank you. :)
