JUST DOWNLOAD THE ZIP , then UNZIP it and run the CPP FILE. Give INPUT 100 and 100 as the length of the DNA STRANDS.

The main code is in "PROJECT-FINAL.cpp"

The code needs "File1" file and "File2" file to be in the same folder in which the code is, it contains the length of 2 DNA strands that we are comparing.

The code takes the length of DNA strands as input, for example if the length of the first strand is 100 give 100 as input and if the length of the second strand is 200 give 200 as the next input. Then it compares the similarity between them.

"File1" folder contains a DNA sequences of length 100 and "File1" folder also contains another DNA sequence of length 100

This website--> https://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/random_dna.html can be used to generate random DNA sequence


Hope you enjoy the code. Thank you. :)
